## About Me
<img src = "Ankita_Shukla_Photo.jpg" align = "right" width= "250" style = "margin-left:5px">

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of Nevada Reno, USA. Before joining UNR, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in [GML](https://pavanturaga.com/geometric-media-lab/), working with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) at Arizona State University. I defended my PhD in Oct, 2020 from IIIT-Delhi under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/). My dissertation title is "Exploring Geometric Constraints for Learning Representations for Visual Data". During my PhD, I also worked as a visiting research scholar with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) for 6 months in 2019 (Feb - Aug) as well as during the summer of 2017.
I received my Master's degree from IIIT-Delhi. I was awarded Best Thesis Award for my thesis titled "Signal Processing Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in EEG Acquisition and Transmission for WBAN" under the guidance of [Dr. Angshul Majumdar](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~angshul/index.htm).

My research interests lie in deep learning and machine learning approaches for visual and time series data, topological data analysis, differential geometry and geometry driven approaches for learning. From the applications point of view, I focus on AI for Science and AI for Social Good (specifically towards wildlife conservation and human health applications). 
<!---My work as a PhD student has two aspects. The first aspect focuses on leveraging semantic and geometric constraints for developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This includes distance metric learning in traditional machine learning, as well as current work that focuses on geometry aware deep learning. The other aspect focuses on AI for Science and AI for Social Good, specifically towards visual wildlife monitoring applications.>
