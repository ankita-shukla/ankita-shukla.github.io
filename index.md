## About Me

I am a PhD student at IIIT Delhi in ECE Department. I am advised by [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/). I am working as a research intern with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) for 6 months (Feb - Aug 2019) and previously interned with him during Summer 2017 in the [Geometric Media Lab](https://pavanturaga.com/geometric-media-lab/), Arizona State Universty, USA.

I recieved my Master's degree from IIIT-Delhi. I was awarded Best Thesis Award for my thesis titled "Signal Processing Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in EEG Acquisition and Transmission for WBAN" urder the guidance of [Dr. Angshul Majumdar](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~angshul/index.htm).

My reserach interest lie in Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approaches for Computer Vision Applications, Topological Data Analysis, Diffferential Geometry and Geometry driven appraoches for learning.
